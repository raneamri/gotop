# GoTop (EARLY-DEV)
Innotop for MySQL (& other DBMSs) written in GoLang.
Developed over the course of my 2023 summer internship.

## Startup
GoTop can be called using the command:

```bash
    go run gotop
```

or called with arguments:
```bash
    go run gotop <dbms> <user> <pass> <host> <port> <db-name>
```

Upon successful TCP connection, instance will be written in config for easy access in the future.

## Interface
Yet to come.
